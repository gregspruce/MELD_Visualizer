# Subagent-Based Test Suite Rebuild Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines how we will leverage specialized subagents and MCPs to execute a complete test suite rebuild for the MELD Visualizer application. By utilizing domain-specific expertise from various agents, we can create a more robust, maintainable, and comprehensive testing infrastructure than would be possible with a single-agent approach.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Testing Stack
- **Primary Framework**: Playwright MCP for browser automation
- **Unit Testing**: Python's built-in unittest with specialized agents
- **Integration Layer**: Custom test orchestration using multiple agents
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated test execution

## Conclusion

This subagent-based approach leverages specialized expertise to create a superior test suite that would be difficult to achieve with a single agent. By orchestrating multiple agents, each contributing their domain knowledge, we can build a comprehensive, maintainable, and robust testing infrastructure.

The key advantages of this approach:

1. **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent brings deep domain knowledge
2. **Parallel Development**: Multiple agents can work on different aspects
3. **Quality Assurance**: Multiple perspectives catch more issues
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new test types with new agents

The combination of Playwright MCP's powerful browser automation with specialized agent expertise creates a testing framework that ensures the MELD Visualizer application remains stable, performant, and user-friendly across all platforms and use cases.
