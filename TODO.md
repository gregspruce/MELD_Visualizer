## üî¥ Critical Priority

### Code Quality & Maintenance
- [ ] **Enhanced UI Callbacks Investigation** - Determine why enhanced_ui_callbacks are disabled and either fix or remove
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure Repair** - Fix pytest.ini syntax errors preventing test execution
- [ ] **Legacy Code Cleanup** - Remove PyVista backup files (4 .bak files in components/ and callbacks/)
- [ ] **Error Handling Standardization** - Implement consistent error patterns across all modules

### Documentation & Compliance
- [x] **Create TODO.md** - This file (completed)
- [ ] **Create CHANGELOG.md** - Following Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] **Update improvement_plan.md** - Reflect actual codebase findings from triage

---

## üü° High Priority

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - Currently only 4 test files exist, target 80% coverage
- [ ] **Integration Test Suite** - Test callback chains and component interactions
- [ ] **E2E Test Implementation** - Browser automation for critical user workflows
- [ ] **Performance Regression Tests** - Ensure optimization changes don't hurt performance

### Code Improvements
- [ ] **Type Annotations** - Add comprehensive type hints to all public APIs
- [ ] **Magic Number Extraction** - Move hardcoded values to constants.py
- [ ] **Import Organization** - Standardize import patterns and remove circular dependencies
- [ ] **Code Formatting** - Apply black/flake8 consistently across codebase

---

## üü¢ Medium Priority

### Architecture & Modularity
- [ ] **Callback System Completion** - Finish modularization of callback registration
- [ ] **Service Layer Consistency** - Ensure clean separation between services and UI
- [ ] **Configuration Management** - Centralize all configuration loading and validation
- [ ] **Dependency Injection** - Implement basic DI pattern for better testability

### Security & Validation
- [ ] **Input Validation Audit** - Review all user input endpoints for security
- [ ] **File Upload Security** - Enhance security measures for CSV/G-code uploads
- [ ] **Configuration Schema** - Add validation for config.json structure
- [ ] **Rate Limiting** - Implement appropriate rate limiting for file operations

---

## üîµ Low Priority

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] **Performance Profiling** - Identify bottlenecks in data processing
- [ ] **Cache Optimization** - Improve cache hit rates and eviction strategies

- [ ] **Development Setup Guide** - Improve onboarding documentation
- [ ] **Code Examples** - Add usage examples for key components
- [ ] **Debugging Tools** - Enhance development debugging capabilities

---

## üö´ Blocked/Deferred

### Abandoned Features
- [x] **PyVista Integration** - Decided against implementation, cleanup .bak files instead
- [ ] **Trame Integration** - Evaluate if needed or should be removed entirely

### Future Considerations
- [ ] **Multi-user Support** - Consider implications for shared deployments
- [ ] **Cloud Storage Integration** - Support for cloud-based file storage
- [ ] **Real-time Collaboration** - Multi-user editing capabilities
- [ ] **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible plugin system for custom features

## üìù Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Always run tests before committing changes
- Update documentation immediately after code changes
- Use feature branches for all non-trivial changes
- Follow semantic versioning for releases

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions and classes
- Integration tests for service interactions
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
- Performance tests for data processing pipelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Type hints required for all public APIs
- Docstrings required for all classes and functions
- Error handling must be comprehensive and user-friendly
- No hardcoded values outside of constants.py
