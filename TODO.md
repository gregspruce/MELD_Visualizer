# MELD Visualizer - TODO

**Generated:** 2025-09-10
**Status:** Active Development
**Branch:** systematic-improvements

## üîÑ RESUME GUIDANCE FOR NEW CLAUDE CODE SESSIONS

### Current State Summary
- **Critical Infrastructure**: COMPLETE (4/4 tasks - 100%)
- **Error Handling**: Enterprise-grade framework implemented with 35 tests
- **Code Organization**: Magic numbers eliminated, imports standardized
- **Test Coverage**: Added 100+ tests across security, volume mesh, error handling
- **Next Phase**: High-priority development tasks ready to begin

### Key Implementation Files
```
src/meld_visualizer/utils/error_handling.py    # Complete framework - 95% coverage
tests/python/unit/test_error_handling.py        # 35 comprehensive tests
src/meld_visualizer/constants.py                # Centralized constants (30+)
src/meld_visualizer/core/data_processing.py     # Standardized error patterns
```

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Integration Test Suite** (high impact, builds on error framework)
2. **Type Annotations** (clean imports make this straightforward)
3. **E2E Test Implementation** (professional error handling supports this)
4. **Code Formatting** (standardized patterns ready for formatting)

### Testing Commands
```bash
python -m pytest tests/python/unit/test_error_handling.py -v    # Verify error framework
python -m pytest tests/python/unit/test_volume_mesh.py -v      # Verify mesh tests
python -m pytest tests/python/unit/test_security_utils.py -v   # Verify security tests
```

This document tracks current known issues, planned improvements, and development tasks for the MELD Visualizer project.
