## üéØ Next Priority Targets

### High-Impact Testing Opportunities
Based on coverage analysis, the following modules offer the highest ROI for test coverage improvements:

1. **Enhanced UI Callbacks** (`callbacks/enhanced_ui_callbacks.py`)
   - **Impact**: 133 missing lines (0% coverage)
   - **Status**: Currently disabled/unused - needs investigation
   - **Priority**: Critical - determine if needed or can be removed

2. **Volume Mesh** (`core/volume_mesh.py`) 
   - **Impact**: 110 missing lines (17.9% coverage)
   - **Status**: Core functionality with low test coverage
   - **Priority**: High - critical for 3D visualization features

3. **Services & Callbacks** (82-74 missing lines each)
   - Multiple modules with significant untested code
   - Good candidates for systematic coverage improvement

### Coverage Improvement Strategy
- **Target**: Reach 75% overall code coverage (currently ~36%)
- **Method**: Focus on high-impact modules (100+ untested lines)
- **Tools**: Use `analyze_coverage.py` to track progress systematically

## üìù Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Always run tests before committing changes
- Update documentation immediately after code changes
- Use feature branches for all non-trivial changes
- Follow semantic versioning for releases

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions and classes
- Integration tests for service interactions
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
- Performance tests for data processing pipelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Type hints required for all public APIs
- Docstrings required for all classes and functions
- Error handling must be comprehensive and user-friendly
- No hardcoded values outside of constants.py
