Notes on formats:

CSV headers are tiny on purpose.

G: c,s,m,d,p,n → code, short desc, modal?, default?, params (|-joined), notes

M: c,s,t,w,p,n → code, short desc, type (hs|fb), timing (pre|post), params, notes

JSONL records are one per line, merged G+M:

G: {"r":"g","c":"G01","s":"linear","m":"1","d":0,"p":["F"],"n":""}

M: {"r":"m","c":"M04","s":"spindle_on_ccw","t":"hs","w":"post","p":["S(rpm)"],"n":"waits to ≥95%"}
