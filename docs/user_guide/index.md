## 3. Enhanced Desktop User Interface

The MELD Visualizer features an enhanced desktop UI designed for improved usability and responsiveness.

### Core Components

The Enhanced UI is composed of several key components:

*   **Enhanced Tabs:** A tab navigation system with overflow handling and keyboard navigation.

*   **User Feedback System:** A system for providing users with feedback, including toast notifications, loading overlays, and progress indicators.

### Key Features

*   **Responsive Design:** The UI is optimized for a range of desktop resolutions, from 1024x768 to 2560x1440 and beyond.
*   **Accessibility:** The system is designed to be WCAG 2.1 compliant, with features like keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and high-contrast-friendly styling.
*   **Performance:** The system is designed to be performant, with client-side optimizations to reduce server load and provide a smooth user experience.

### Component Creation (for advanced users/developers)

*   **Enhanced Tabs**
    ```python
    from src.meld_visualizer.core import layout

    tabs = layout.create_enhanced_tabs(
        tabs_config=[
            {'id': 'tab1', 'label': 'Tab 1', 'content': content1},
            {'id': 'tab2', 'label': 'Tab 2', 'content': content2}
        ],
        active_tab='tab1'
    )
    ```

*   **Control Panel**
    ```python
    from src.meld_visualizer.core import layout

    panel = layout.create_control_panel(
        title="Settings",
        controls=[...],
        collapsible=True,
        initial_collapsed=False
    )
    ```

## 4. Interactive Volume Calibration Tool

This section provides instructions for using the interactive volume calibration tool, `interactive_volume_calibration.py`.

### Purpose

The `interactive_volume_calibration.py` script provides a terminal-based interactive interface for performing volume calibration and analyzing volume distribution of MELD prints. It leverages the core volume calculation logic from the `src/meld_visualizer` package.

### Script Location

The script is located at:
`c:\VSCode\AFSD_Programs\MELD_Visualizer\tools\interactive_volume_calibration.py`

### How to Run

To run the interactive tool, execute the script from your terminal. It is recommended to suppress the default logging from the `meld_visualizer` package for a cleaner console output by setting the `MELD_LOGGING` environment variable to `false`.

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:MELD_LOGGING="false"; python c:\VSCode\AFSD_Programs\MELD_Visualizer\tools\interactive_volume_calibration.py
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**

```cmd
set MELD_LOGGING=false && python c:\VSCode\AFSD_Programs\MELD_Visualizer\tools\interactive_volume_calibration.py
```

**On Linux/macOS:**

```bash
MELD_LOGGING=false python c:\VSCode\AFSD_Programs\MELD_Visualizer\tools\interactive_volume_calibration.py
```

### Usage

Upon running the script, you will be presented with a main menu:

```
========================================
MELD Volume Calibration Tool (Interactive)
========================================
1. Perform Volume Calibration
2. Analyze Volume Distribution
3. Exit
========================================
Enter your choice (1-3):
```

#### Option 1: Perform Volume Calibration

This option guides you through calibrating the volume calculations based on a physical measurement. You will be prompted to provide:

*   **Path to CSV file:** The path to a CSV file generated from a MELD print (e.g., `data/csv/20250707144618.csv`).
*   **Measured physical volume in cmÂ³:** The actual measured volume of the physical print in cubic centimeters.

The script will then calculate a correction factor, validate the calibration, and save the updated calibration configuration to `config/volume_calibration.json`.

#### Option 2: Analyze Volume Distribution

This option allows you to analyze the volume distribution throughout a MELD print. You will be prompted to provide:

*   **Path to CSV file:** The path to a CSV file generated from a MELD print.

The script will process the data and provide layer-by-layer analysis, including bead area and thickness variations, which can help identify if non-uniform calibration is needed.

#### Option 3: Exit

Exits the interactive tool.

### Dependencies and Configuration

*   The script relies on the `pandas` library for data handling and modules within the `src/meld_visualizer/core` package for volume calculations.
*   Calibration settings are loaded from and saved to `config/volume_calibration.json`. Ensure this file exists or is created in the `config/` directory relative to the project root. If the file does not exist, default values will be used for feedstock and bead geometry.

## 5. Configuration

The MELD Visualizer can be configured through `config/config.json`. This file allows you to specify various application settings, including themes, plot options, and column mappings.
