# Project Development Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the major development phases and features of the MELD Visualizer project.

## Core Features and Enhancements

- **Data Pipeline and Caching:** The application uses a data pipeline that caches CSV data to Parquet for faster loading times.
- **Configuration and Column Mapping:** The application supports configuration validation and allows users to map CSV columns to the application's data model.
- **Performance and Level of Detail (LOD):** The application includes performance optimizations such as data decimation and a payload cap to ensure smooth interaction with large datasets.
- **Voxelization and Isosurface Mode:** The application can visualize large datasets as voxelized volumes and isosurfaces.
- **Region of Interest (ROI) Selection and Cross-filtering:** Users can select a region of interest in the 3D view and filter the data in other plots accordingly.
- **Error Handling and User Feedback:** The application includes an error panel and provides users with feedback during long-running operations.
- **Session Management and Export:** Users can save and load their sessions and export visualizations to images.
- **Enhanced Desktop UI:** The application features an enhanced desktop UI with improved navigation, control panel organization, and user feedback.

## Development Roadmap

The following is a high-level overview of the development roadmap:

1.  **Infrastructure and CI/CD:** Set up the project structure, dependencies, and CI/CD pipeline.
2.  **Data Pipeline:** Implement the data pipeline with CSV to Parquet caching.
3.  **Configuration and UI:** Develop the configuration validation and column mapping UI.
4.  **Performance Optimizations:** Implement performance optimizations such as LOD and data decimation.
5.  **Advanced Visualization:** Add support for voxelization and isosurface rendering.
6.  **Interactivity:** Implement ROI selection and cross-filtering.
7.  **UX and Error Handling:** Improve the user experience with better error handling and feedback.
8.  **Session Management:** Add support for saving and loading sessions.
9.  **Testing:** Enhance the test suite with snapshot and property-based testing.
10. **Packaging and Release:** Package the application for Windows and set up a release pipeline.
