# Test Suite Rebuild Plan with Playwright MCP

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan to remove the existing Selenium-based testing infrastructure and rebuild it using Playwright MCP for superior testing of the MELD Visualizer Dash application.

## Why Playwright MCP for Dash Testing

### Key Advantages
- **Real browser automation** without Selenium WebDriver complexity
- **Built-in waiting strategies** for dynamic Dash callbacks
- **Network interception** to test API calls and data loading
- **Cross-browser testing** (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **Code generation** to accelerate test creation
- **Visual regression testing** with screenshot comparisons

### Dash-Specific Benefits
Dash applications have unique testing challenges that Playwright MCP handles elegantly:
1. Callbacks fire asynchronously after component updates
2. Plotly graphs render progressively with WebGL
3. File uploads trigger complex server-side processing
4. Real-time data updates via WebSocket connections

## Phase 1: Remove Legacy Testing Infrastructure

### Actions Required
```bash
# Remove Selenium-based tests
rm -rf tests/e2e/
rm -rf tests/integration/
rm scripts/run_tests*.sh

# Clean up test configurations
rm tests/pytest.ini
rm tests/test_suite.conf

# Keep only pure Python unit tests temporarily
# Remove Selenium dependencies from pyproject.toml
```

### Dependencies to Remove
- selenium
- webdriver-manager
- pytest-selenium
