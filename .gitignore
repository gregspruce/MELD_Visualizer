# ============================================
# Project-specific patterns after reorganization
# ============================================

# Logs - don't track log files but keep the directory
logs/*.log
logs/*.txt
# Keep the logs directory itself
!logs/.gitkeep

# Reports - track structure but not generated reports
reports/*.html
reports/coverage/
reports/*.json
# Keep report directories
!reports/.gitkeep

# Data - be selective about what data to track
data/csv/*.tmp
data/csv/*.bak
# Large data files (add specific patterns as needed)
# data/csv/large_*.csv

# Cleanup folder - KEEPING THIS TRACKED
# The Cleanup folder contains files under review
# It is intentionally tracked in version control
# for collaborative review and decision making
# Cleanup/  # <-- NOT adding this, so it stays tracked

# Temporary files that might appear during cleanup
*.tmp
*.bak
