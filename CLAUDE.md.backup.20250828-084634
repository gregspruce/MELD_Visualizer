# CLAUDE.md - Universal Standing Instructions

This document contains universal standing instructions for AI assistants working on any software project. These instructions are project-agnostic and can be applied across different codebases.

---

## üî¥ EXPLICIT STANDING INSTRUCTIONS (Required)

These instructions MUST be followed when working on any software project:

### 1. Tool & Agent Awareness
- **STAY AWARE** of all available subagents at all times
- **PROACTIVELY USE** relevant subagents without being asked when appropriate
- **STAY AWARE** of all available MCPs (Model Context Protocols)
- **PROACTIVELY USE** relevant MCPs when they can improve task completion

### 2. Code Organization & Quality
- **KEEP** repository structure logical, organized, and neat
- **ENSURE** all code includes useful and understandable comments for both humans and AI
  - Comments should explain WHY, not just WHAT
  - Complex logic should be thoroughly documented
  - API interactions should include example requests/responses in comments
- **ENFORCE** file and script naming conventions that are concise but understandable
  - Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose and functionality
  - Employ sequential naming (01_, 02_, 03_) for workflow scripts when appropriate
  - Avoid ambiguous or overly abbreviated names that require context to understand
- **REMOVE** scripts or documentation files that are replaced by newer versions
  - Maintain an explicit log file detailing what files are removed
  - Document commit/branch/repo information for recovery if needed
  - Preserve removal context for later human/AI understanding
- **PERIODICALLY RE-EVALUATE** repository structure and imports using appropriate subagents
  - Use code-reviewer and architect-reviewer agents to assess organization
  - Identify redundant functionality and consolidation opportunities
  - Ensure logical grouping and clear dependency relationships

### 3. Project Management
- **MAINTAIN** a running CHANGELOG.md file
  - Update with every significant change
  - Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- **MAINTAIN** a running TODO.md list
  - Update immediately when items are completed
  - Add new items as they are discovered
  - Include priority levels and deadlines when known

### 4. Code Excellence Standard
- **ALWAYS AIM** for code and implementations that, in retrospect, are the ONLY solution any expert would arrive at
  - This means choosing the most elegant, efficient, and maintainable approach
  - Avoid clever tricks in favor of clear, obvious solutions
  - The code should feel inevitable, not arbitrary

### 5. Documentation Requirements
- **MAINTAIN** updated documentation for both users and developers
- **ASSUME** later users and developers may be of ANY skill level
  - Include basic setup instructions
  - Provide advanced configuration options
  - Add troubleshooting guides
  - Include code examples for common use cases
- **UPDATE** scripts and documentation for ALL changes, especially when approaches change
  - When libraries/frameworks are replaced due to insufficiency, remove old references from active docs
  - References to deprecated approaches should only remain in changelogs and history documents
  - User guides, APIs, and README files must reflect current/working approaches only
  - Maintain "Last Updated" entries in all documentation files
  - Add changelog summaries to track approach evolution and reasoning

### 6. Code Compatibility
- **AVOID** using unicode symbols in code and scripts where they will cause logic or visual errors
  - Verify any unicode that is still used will not cause any errors before reporting success

### 7. Performance Priority
- **PRIORITIZE** efficiency in both code execution and application resource usage
  - Minimize API calls
  - Implement caching where appropriate
  - Use async operations for I/O bound tasks
  - Profile and optimize bottlenecks

### 8. Safety First Principle
- **INTERACTIONS** with production systems CANNOT break existing functionalities without explicit confirmation
  - Always test in a safe environment first
  - Provide rollback instructions
  - Document any breaking changes clearly
  - Request explicit user confirmation before implementing breaking changes

5. **Code Style**
   - Follow language-specific style guides (PEP 8 for Python, etc.)
   - Use type hints/annotations where available
   - Implement docstrings/JSDoc for all public APIs
   - Keep functions small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle)
   - Use meaningful variable and function names

6. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Log performance metrics
   - Implement timeout handling for external calls
   - Use connection pooling for database/API connections
   - Implement circuit breakers for external services
   - Profile code to identify bottlenecks
   - Cache expensive computations

7. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear setup instructions in README.md
   - Include configuration examples
   - Implement helpful default values
   - Provide migration guides for breaking changes
   - Include a FAQ section for common issues
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation

8. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Monitor for security vulnerabilities
   - Refactor code when patterns emerge
   - Seek feedback from users
   - Keep up with framework/library updates
   - Regular code reviews

9. **AI-Specific Considerations**
   - Structure code to be easily understood by future AI assistants
   - Include context about design decisions
   - Document any non-obvious architectural choices
   - Maintain a glossary of project-specific terms
   - Use clear, consistent naming conventions

10. **Collaboration Best Practices**
    - Write self-documenting code
    - Maintain up-to-date documentation
    - Use issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
    - Implement PR templates with checklists
    - Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
    - Maintain a contribution guide

## üìã Universal Development Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module/class should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract common functionality into reusable components
- Use configuration files for values that might change
- Create utility functions for repeated operations
- Maintain single sources of truth

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Favor simple solutions over complex ones
- Write code that is easy to understand
- Avoid premature optimization
- Remove unnecessary complexity

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Don't add functionality until it's needed
- Avoid speculative generality
- Focus on current requirements
- Refactor when patterns emerge

### Boy Scout Rule
- Leave the code better than you found it
- Fix broken windows (small issues) immediately
- Refactor as you go
- Update documentation when you change code

## üîß Universal Troubleshooting Approach

### Debugging Strategy
1. **Reproduce the issue** - Ensure you can consistently reproduce the problem
2. **Isolate the problem** - Narrow down to the smallest failing case
3. **Form hypotheses** - Think about what could cause the issue
4. **Test systematically** - Test one hypothesis at a time
5. **Document the fix** - Record what caused the issue and how it was fixed

### Common Debugging Techniques
- Use debugger tools and breakpoints
- Add strategic logging statements
- Use binary search to find issues
- Check recent changes (git bisect)
- Verify assumptions with assertions
- Test in isolation (unit tests)
- Check external dependencies
- Review error messages carefully

### Performance Optimization
1. **Measure first** - Profile before optimizing
2. **Identify bottlenecks** - Find the actual slow parts
3. **Optimize algorithms** - Better algorithms beat micro-optimizations
4. **Cache appropriately** - Store expensive computations
5. **Batch operations** - Reduce round trips
6. **Use appropriate data structures** - Choose the right tool for the job
7. **Monitor in production** - Real-world performance matters

## üìù Notes for AI Assistants

When working on any project:
1. Check for project-specific CLAUDE.md or similar documentation
2. Read README.md to understand the project
3. Review recent commits to understand current work
4. Check for TODO.md or issue tracker for pending tasks
5. Ensure all changes align with standing instructions
6. Update documentation immediately after code changes
7. Test thoroughly before committing
8. Ask for clarification if instructions conflict

### Priority Order for Instructions
1. **Project-specific CLAUDE.md** (highest priority)
2. **This general CLAUDE.md** 
3. **Project README and documentation**
4. **Framework/library best practices**
5. **General programming principles** (lowest priority)

Remember: The goal is to create code that is not just functional, but exemplary - the kind of solution that makes other developers say "Of course, that's exactly how it should be done."
