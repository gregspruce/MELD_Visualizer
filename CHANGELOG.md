## Notable Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Dash Framework**: Selected for Python-native web development and scientific visualization
- **Plotly Integration**: Chosen for interactive 3D plotting capabilities
- **Bootstrap Themes**: Implemented for consistent, professional UI design
- **Modular Callbacks**: Organized by functional domain for maintainability
- **src-layout**: Modern Python package structure for better organization

### Performance Optimizations
- **LRU Caching**: Implemented for expensive data processing operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Configuration and theme resources loaded on demand
- **Streaming Processing**: Large file handling with progress indicators
- **Memory Management**: Explicit cleanup of large datasets

### Security Measures
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **File Upload Security**: Size limits, type validation, and content scanning
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
- **Configuration Security**: Sensitive settings handled via environment variables
